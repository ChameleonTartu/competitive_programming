## General information
This repository is created with aim to prepare to competitions and keep myself in good shape for interviews.

I am mainly focused on:
- Codeforces
- HackerRank
- Timus
- e-olymp

websites. In the future I will add more, but for now I think that it is fairly enough.

There are several websites extra I am using to preparation, solutions from which I will not share, at least, for now.

My favorites:
- Codefights
- InterviewBit

## Strategy

I have a grid for each day, I need to solve from 5 to 10 tasks/day from different sources. I am commiting task just after solving it and to make myself confident in all aspects of language. I have decided to start from simpliest ones and increase complexity.
